            The Game About Things is a digital board game based on D&D combat. It uses a microbit to tell you the results of background dice rolls and the outcome of battles.
            It is also used to select your class and level up. The goal of the game is to reach level ten and defeat the dragon or collect enough gold and escape. Each class has different
            stats and styles of gameplay. It is a single player game but it could be multi-player with additional microbits. Enjoy the experience of an adventure in a board game format!
            Find it in stores near you at the price of $0.03!
