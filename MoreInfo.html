      I was inspired by a game I played with my uncle called Dungeon. I was surprised by how much focus goes into balancing the game.
      One time, I was having trouble getting enemies to take damage. When Ms. Hines told me that changing a variable only applies to 
      positive numbers, I used 0 - damage to fix it. The microbit is essential for combat, class selection, and sneaking.
      The reviewers said everything was good but suggested more rooms. I used conditional statements to determine the outcomes of 
      dice rolls in battles. I decided on yellow letters for gold and grey background for stone. The most difficult part was adding the 
      pictures. I am most proud of the microbit code because I spent a lot of time on it.
